# Product Requirements Document: Conway's Game of Life

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for a digital implementation of John Conway's Game of Life. The application will provide a sandbox for users to explore the fascinating emergent behavior of cellular automata. Users can select from preset patterns or create their own, observing how they evolve over time.

## 2. Goals

*   **Primary Goal:** To create a fully functional, intuitive, and engaging simulation of Conway's Game of Life.
*   **User Engagement:** Allow users to be creative by designing their own patterns and experimenting with the rules of the game.
*   **Educational:** To provide a tool for understanding the concepts of emergent complexity and cellular automata.
*   **Future-Proofing:** To build a foundation for more advanced simulations, including evolutionary algorithms.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a casual user, I want to select a cool-looking pattern and watch it run.
*   As a creative user, I want to draw my own starting configuration on the grid to see what happens.
*   As an advanced user, I want to be able to pause the simulation, advance it step-by-step, and control the speed to analyze a pattern's behavior.
*   As a curious user, I want to save a pattern I've made and come back to it later.

## 4. Requirements

### 4.1. Core Gameplay

*   **Game Grid:** An interactive, zoomable, and pannable grid representing the universe.
*   **Game Logic:** The simulation must correctly implement the standard rules of Conway's Game of Life:
    1.  A live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (underpopulation).
    2.  A live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
    3.  A live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (overpopulation).
    4.  A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).
*   **State Display:** The current generation number should be visible.

### 4.2. Patterns

*   **Preset Library:** The application will ship with a library of well-known patterns, including:
    *   **Oscillators:** Blinker, Toad, Pulsar
    *   **Spaceships:** Glider, Lightweight spaceship (LWSS)
    *   **Methuselahs:** R-pentomino
    *   **Guns:** Gosper Glider Gun
*   **Pattern Creation:** Users must be able to activate or deactivate cells on the grid by clicking/tapping on them. This allows for the creation of custom patterns.
*   **Pattern Saving/Loading:** A mechanism to save and load user-created patterns.

### 4.3. Simulation Controls

*   **Play/Pause:** Start and stop the simulation.
*   **Step Forward:** Advance the simulation by a single generation.
*   **Reset:** Clear the grid and reset the generation count to zero.
*   **Speed Control:** A slider or set of predefined speeds (e.g., 1x, 2x, 4x) to control the simulation rate.

## 5. Future Ideas

*   **Evolutionary Simulation:**
    *   Introduce a "challenge mode" where the goal is to create a pattern that achieves a specific objective (e.g., "design a glider that travels the furthest in 1000 generations").
    *   Track metrics for patterns, such as population size, lifespan, and distance traveled for spaceships.
    *   Simulate evolution by introducing random mutations to patterns and selecting for certain traits over many generations.
*   **Social & Sharing:**
    *   Export/import patterns in a common format (e.g., RLE, Plaintext) to share with the wider Game of Life community.
*   **Customization:**
    *   Allow users to change the colors of the cells and background.
    *   Support for different rulesets (e.g., HighLife, Day & Night).
